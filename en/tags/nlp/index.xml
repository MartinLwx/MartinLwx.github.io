    <description><![CDATA[A taxonomy of tokenization methods In NLP, one crux of problems is - how to tokenize the text. There are three methods available:
Char-level Word-level Subword-level Let&rsquo;s talk about the Char-level tokenizer. That is, we tokenize the text into a char stream. For instance, highest -&gt; h, i, g, h, e, s, t. One advantage of the Char-level tokenizer is that the size of Vocab won&rsquo;t be that large. The size of Vocab is equal to the size of the alphabet.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[What is the TF-IDF model In previous post, we talked about the bag-of-word model, which has many limitations. Today we take a step further to see if we can try to fix one of the limitations - Each word has the same importance.
ðŸ’¡ The crux of the problem - How to define the word importance?
One idea is: The more frequently a word appears within a single document, the more important it is for that document.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[What is the bag-of-word model? In NLP, we need to represent each document as a vector because machine learning can only accept input as numbers. That is, we want to find a magic function that: $$ f(\text{document}) = vector $$
Today&rsquo;s topic is bag-of-word(BoW) model, which can transform a document into a vector representation.
ðŸ’¡ Although the BoW model is outdated in 2023, I still encourage you to learn from the history and think about some essential problems:]]></description>

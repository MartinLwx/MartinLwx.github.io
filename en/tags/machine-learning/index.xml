    <title>TF-IDF model</title>

    <description><![CDATA[What is the TF-IDF model In previous post, we talked about the bag-of-word model, which has many limitations. Today we take a step further to see if we can try to fix one of the limitations - Each word has the same importance.
💡 The crux of the problem - How to define the word importance?
One idea is: The more frequently a word appears within a single document, the more important it is for that document.]]></description>

    <title>Bag-of-Word model</title>

    <description><![CDATA[What is the bag-of-word model? In NLP, we need to represent each document as a vector because machine learning can only accept input as numbers. That is, we want to find a magic function that: $$ f(\text{document}) = vector $$
Today&rsquo;s topic is bag-of-word(BoW) model, which can transform a document into a vector representation.
💡 Although the BoW model is outdated in 2023, I still encourage you to learn from the history and think about some essential problems:]]></description>

    <title>A trick to calculating partial derivatives in machine learning</title>

    <description><![CDATA[Intro You may have difficulties when trying to calculate the partial derivatives in machine learning like me. Even though I found a good reference cookbook that could be used to derive the gradients, I still got confused. Today, I want to share a practical technique I recently learned from this video: when calculating partial derivatives in machine learning, you can treat everything as if it were a scalar and then make the shapes match]]></description>

    <title>Linear Regression Model Guide - theory part</title>
    <link>https://martinlwx.github.io/en/linear-regression-model-guide-theory/</link>

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction Recently, I review the machine learning course of Andrew ng in Coursera. Surprisingly, I can still learn a lot, so I decided to write some posts👍.
To talk about linear regression, we must first have a basic understanding of what is machine learning. What is machine learning? abstractly speaking, machine learning is learning a function: $$ f(input) = output $$ where $f$ refers to the specific machine learning model. Machine learning is a methodology for automatically mining the relationship between input and output.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[What&rsquo;s MPNN Justin Gilmer proposed the MPNN (Message Passing Neural Network) framework 1 for describing graph neural network models used in supervised learning on graphs. I found this to be a useful framework that provides a clear understanding of how different GNN models work and facilitates a quick grasp of the differences between them. Considering a node $v$ on the graph $G$, the update procedure for its vector representation $h_v$ is as follows:]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Intro In the field of deep learning, optimizing the network involves a crucial process of continuously updating the weights and bias items. This is achieved by implementing the gradient descent method, which progressively minimizes the loss function. At the heart of this process lies the backpropagation algorithm, which facilitates efficient computation of gradients across the network
To better understand this concept, let us recall the formula for gradient descent. In this formula, we utilize the symbol $\theta$ to represent all the learnable parameters of the model, $J$ to represent the cost or loss function, and $\alpha$ to denote the learning rate.]]></description>

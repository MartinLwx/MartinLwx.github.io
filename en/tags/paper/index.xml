    <description><![CDATA[What&rsquo;s LoRA Since the era of LLM(large language model) arrived, fine-tuning LLM has become a challenge because the LLM models are extremely large, making it difficult to perform full fine-tuning. There are mainly two approaches: freeze the entire LLM and perform prompt tuning or In-context Learning; freeze the entire LLM but inserting trainable modules. Today, I will introduce the LoRA(Low-Rank Adaptation), which corresponds to the latter technical approach. This is a work proposed by the Microsoft team1]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[What&rsquo;s MPNN Justin Gilmer proposed the MPNN (Message Passing Neural Network) framework 1 for describing graph neural network models used in supervised learning on graphs. I found this to be a useful framework that provides a clear understanding of how different GNN models work and facilitates a quick grasp of the differences between them. Considering a node $v$ on the graph $G$, the update procedure for its vector representation $h_v$ is as follows:]]></description>

      <description>Intro  I found that the windows management built in macOS is difficult to use. As a result, I always using my mouse to move and resize my window, which is less efficient. We should keep our hands on the keyboard as much as possible. After finishing the MIT-Missing-Semester, I came across the hammerspoon tool. I really like this one :)
What is hammerspoon ?  According to the official site&amp;rsquo;s introduction, hammerspoon is a tool for powerful automation of OS X, which is just a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine.</description>
